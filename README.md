# caesar-cipher
Cipher for strings

Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter of a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. When the shift is 13, the cipher is also known as ROT13, because it rotates the letters halfway through the alphabet. ROT13 is often used for hiding spoilers or jokes online.

In this case, this project is a simple and effective program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages with a single click. So is easy to use and can protect your messages from prying eyes.
